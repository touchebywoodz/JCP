    SPEAKER NOTES (2 minutes):
    - Humor: "Churches were like the Facebook of their time - they recorded everything! Who was 'friends' with who, who got 'unfriended' or disciplined... it's all there."
    - Tip: "When you see disciplinary records, don't just see the negative. These often name spouses, parents, or siblings who came to speak on their behalf, revealing valuable family connections."
    - Explain: "Pay special attention to Ladies' auxiliary records. These were often run by women for women, and they frequently list members by their married AND maiden names, a huge clue for genealogists."
    - Encourage: "It's easy to skip over what looks like boring administrative records, but as you can see, they are filled with hidden gems that paint a rich picture of our ancestors' community lives. Don't overlook them!"
